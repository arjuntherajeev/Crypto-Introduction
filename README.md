## Main Areas of Code 
This is a Web2Py Web Application written in Python 2.7. 
Web2Py is an MVC (Model-View-Controller) Framework with lots of rich features.
This Application **DOES NOT** make use of a data store. Hence, a _model_ is not used.

The Controller (found at `Crypto-Introduction/controllers/default.py`) contains the definitions of functions which correspond to various actions in the Application.
The View (found at `Crypto-Introduction/views/default/index.html`) contains the HTML required to render the main Web Page of the Application. 

## Fixing Errors
In the above section (__Run Locally__), you _may_ face an Error saying that `GitPython` module is missing. 
To fix: 
* Open a CLI (CMD in Windows)
* Get the `GitPython` package using `pip` - `pip install GitPython`
* If `pip` is **Not Found** - use the complete path; for example - `C:\Python27\Scripts\pip.exe install GitPython`
